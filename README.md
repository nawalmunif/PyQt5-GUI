# PyQt5-GUI
A model GUI using PyQt5.


This PyQt5 GUI focuses on fetching data related to weather and news. 



Future additions would include transition along different pages.


The test2.py file contains weekly weather data fetched at different times.


The news related to technology is displayed.


Navigation between multiple pages is done through keys "a" and "b".


This test GUI could be integrated with any other module. For test I have integrated with https://github.com/Usmaneeyy/Covid-Stats.git Covid Weather Stats. Updates it using pyqt signal so that it automatically fetches the updated data.


PANDEM.py file is the main GUI file.
